Put the output of T as the input to E. But, we know that the halting problem is undecidable, so the problem ‘whether an arbitrary RE language is empty’ is also undecidable.

\textbf{\textit{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!Solution:}} This can be proved by reducing the halting problem to it.

Let M be the TM accepting L. Suppose that Mf is a decider for the finite language problem which
takes the TM M as input.

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!Suppose that there is decider for halting problem which takes TM M and a string w as input.

Now, reduce the halting problem to the finite language problem which constructs the machine $M_{w}$ using the following process.

On input w to M,

\quad

i)\; Design the machine $M_{w}$ such that when M enters into one of its halting states, $M_{w}$ 

\quad\,enters into its final state. $M_{w}$ copies w on some special location of its input tape and 

\quad\,then performs the same computation as M using the input w written on its input tape.

ii)\; If M enters into any one of its halting states, $M_{w}$ halts reaching its final state.

iii)\; If M does not enter into its halting state, $M_{w}$ does not halt and thus accepts nothing.

\,

In other words, $M_{w}$ accepts either the infinite language $\Sigma^{+}$ or the finite language $\phi$.

The final decider is given in the following diagram.

  \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! Already,it is proved that the halting problem is undecidable.So, $M_{f}$ is also undecidable
